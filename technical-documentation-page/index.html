                    JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It
                    is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for
                    example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of
                    its environment to provide programmatic control over them.

                        One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. 
                        He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided 
                        by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. 
                        His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked. "What's happened to me?" he thought. 
                        It wasn't a dream. His room, a proper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully between its four familiar walls. 
                        A collection of textile samples lay spread out on the table - Samsa was a travelling salesman - and above it there hung a picture that he had recently 
                        cut out of an illustrated magazine and housed in a nice, gilded frame. It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff 
                        that covered the whole of her lower arm towards the viewer. Gregor then turned to look out the window at the dull weather. Drops
